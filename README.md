# Control-Importance-Distribution-Algorithm-CIDA
The code here is the one used to solve the numerical example in the paper ``A Control Approach for Nonlinear Stochastic State Uncertain Systems with Probabilistic Safety Guarantees''. 
## TestExample_CIDA.ipynb
This notebook contains the application of CIDA to the example, with more details.
## vectorField.ipynb
This notebook is used to generate the vector field results corresponding to the orbit following and obstacles avoidance shown in the paper.
## configuration.yml
Contains the parameters of CIDA and the case study under consideration.
## Utilities folder
It contains the source code of the CIDA algorithm and particle filtering in object oriented style. It also contains the definition of the dynamics, constraints and the controller used in the example.

Other files and folders are for data and figures used in our example.
